 
# GitHub Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website to **GitHub Pages** using **GitHub Actions**.

## How It Works

* The website consists of a simple `index.html` file
* A GitHub Actions workflow automatically deploys the site to GitHub Pages
* Any change to `index.html` on the `main` branch triggers a redeployment

## Live Website

Once deployed, the site is available at:

https://<username>.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/

(Replace `<username>` with your GitHub username)

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* GitHub Actions
* GitHub Pages
